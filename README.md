# Giphy Explorer Project

## Purpose

The Giphy Explorer project aims to provide a fun and interactive way to search and display GIFs using the Giphy API. The development plan is to start working on this project as a simple application displaying a random GIF and evolve it into a more complex web application, allowing user-driven searches, displaying multiple GIFs, and enhancing user interaction without page reloads.

## Learning Objectives

Through the development of the Giphy Explorer, I aim to solidify my understanding of:

- Making API requests using fetch() and managing responses in JavaScript.
- Handling user inputs and events to trigger API calls.
- Dynamically updating the HTML document based on API data (DOM manipulation).
- Incorporating external libraries and frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap) for responsive design.
- Implementing advanced features such as saving favorites, which may involve using local storage or backend development.
- Structuring a project's codebase and managing dependencies effectively.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Display a Random GIF

    Fetch and display a random GIF from Giphy upon loading the page.

### Phase 2: Interactive GIF Refresh

    Introduce a button allowing users to fetch a new random GIF without reloading the page.

### Phase 3: Search Functionality

    Add a search feature for users to find GIFs based on specific terms.

### Phase 4: Customizable Display

    Enable users to specify the number of GIFs displayed in response to a search.

### Phase 5: Layout and Styling Enhancements

    Utilize Bootstrap for a responsive, grid-based layout and improved UI components.

### Phase 6: Advanced Features

    Explore adding functionalities like saving favorites or sharing GIFs.
